        <h3 id="movie1">Taare Zameen Par</h3>
        <p>
        A reliable tearjerker, Taare Zameen Par shows us the power of love and acceptance through the relationship of an eight-year-old child
        with dyslexia and his compassionate teacher, the only adult who is able to pin down his disability. Traditional Indian educational systems
        are notoriously unsympathetic to mental and learning disabilities; that this film tackled the subject caused a groundswell of positive conversation
        during its release in 2007. It’s one of the most beautiful films of this century, and is unconventional as far as Bollywood goes—there’s noted realism 
         to the story and virtually no song-and-dance numbers—but taps into the heart of cinema: love conquers all, and love can save us, too.

        <h3 id="movie2">Lagaan</h3>
        <p>
            You may have heard of Lagaan, one of the most easy entryways into Bollywood. The film famously received India’s third-ever Academy Award nomination in 2001 and is rooted in a rich entanglement of a high-stakes sports game and a forbidden romance. An epic sports drama based in colonial India, Lagaan is the story of a group of Indian villagers who challenge their British colonizers to a game of cricket in exchange for the removal of their increasingly growing taxes. We get recruiting and training montages, drama amongst teammates, an intercultural flirtation, and a bangin’ soundtrack from the legend A.R. Rahman. It has everything and has been rightfully hailed as one of India’s most entertaining and thoughtful productions that seems to only get better with age.

        <h3 id="movie3">Dil Chahta hai</h3>
        <p>
            A story of youngsters finding themselves, Dil Chahta Hai set the stage for many contemporary Bollywood films when it premiered at the start of the decade. The film is an exploration of mid-20s angst and unrest, of following unconventional desires, of finding happiness amidst the madness. Sameer (Saif Ali Khan) chases a girl out of his league; Siddharth (Akshaye Khanna) lusts after an older divorcee; Akash (Aamir Khan) tries to reconnect with someone from his past. Their decisions test each other and themselves, and cause rifts in their seemingly unbreakable friendship. Dil Chahta Hai is about the bonds of friendship, and just how far they can be stretched.

        <h3 id="movie4">Devdas</h3>
        <p>
        Just like Hollywood, Bollywood has certain stories it keeps coming back to, and Devdas is one of the industry’s favorites. This 2002 film is the third iteration, starring Shah Rukh Khan as Devdas, a man who turns to alcohol and the company of a courtesan after his marriage to his childhood sweetheart is rejected by their families. The period piece is a devastating view of how caste and class have played a role in Indian society, and a depressing end to an epic love story. Grab your tissues for this one.

        <h3 id="movie5">Omkara</h3>
        <p>
            A modern adaptation of Shakespeare’s Othello, Omkara is a politically minded action thriller. Omkara (Ajay Devgn) is a gang leader and political enforcer, who steals a bride (Kareena Kapoor) on her wedding night to keep as his own wife, and later runs for office himself. Leaving his old position vacant, he appoints one of his former lieutenants, Kesu (Vivek Oberoi), to lead the force, which only causes the other loyal servant, Langda (Saif Ali Khan), to seethe in jealousy. Langda sets in motion an elaborate plan to bring down Kesu, but ends up ruining much more than his career. Omkara drew international praise for its performances, story and direction, and is still one of the finest Bollywood films of this century.

        <h3 id="movie6">3 Idiots</h3>
        <p>
            Three engineering students—Rancho (Aamir Khan), Farhan (R. Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi)—are navigating college together, constantly under fire from their tyrant-like headmaster (Boman Irani). Eventually the trio convince him of their abilities and he allows them to graduate. But after graduation, ringleader Rancho disappears from their lives and, years later, the group sets out to find him. 3 Idiots’s charm isn’t just in the story of college friends challenging and supporting one another, or that it does so in comedic moments full of heart. It’s also that the story makes a point to comment on the rigorous expectations of Indian schooling, which sometimes drives students to extreme decisions like suicide.

        <h3 id="movie7">A Wednesday</h3>
        <p>
            Retiring police officer Prakash Rathod (Anupam Kher) describes the most difficult case of his career, which unfolded over the course of a Wednesday afternoon. The case, a bomb threat spread across the city of Mumbai, was never filed and the details are only known to those who witnessed it, and continues to haunt Rathod to this day. A Wednesday is an expertly plotted action thriller that draws well-deserved comparisons to Die Hard and keeps you guessing until the end.

        <h3 id="movie8">Chak de India</h3>
        <p>
            Did you know field hockey is India’s national sport? I’d wager to say that neither did most of the Indian diaspora until Chak De! India was released. The sports drama addresses the tense relations between Pakistan and India head on, as a former, disgraced player from the men’s national Indian team (Shah Rukh Khan) takes over coaching duties for the national women’s team years after he is suspected of throwing a match against Pakistan. In his new coaching role, he molds the women from various states in India to overcome the prejudices they hold against each other and operate as a team. The best sports movies are disguises for deeper, more meaningful conversations, and Chak De! India is a surefire goal.

        <h3 id="movie9">Khakee</h3>
        <p>
            A group of Indian police officers (in excellent turns from Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar and Tusshar Kapoor) set out on a chase to bring in an accused terrorist, Aangre (Ajay Devgn), from a small town outside of Bombay. Knowing the officers are hot on his trail, Aangre sets off a series of events to throw them off his scent. A classic cop film with dramatic twists and unpredictable turns, Khakee is an enthralling thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

        <h3 id="movie10">Veer-Zaara</h3>
        <p>
            A contemporary look at tensions between Muslim and Hindu groups in and around India and Pakistan, Veer-Zaara peers through the lens of Indian cinema’s favorite theme: love. Veer (Shah Rukh Khan), an Indian Air Force pilot, and Zaara (Preity Zinta), a Pakistani woman, fall in love in India. Zaara is engaged to an overbearing Muslim man, and Veer travels to Pakistan to win her and her family over, but he is ultimately jailed. The film was rightly lauded by critics and fans alike for its portrayal of the region’s shared history and conflicts, as well as for the performances by Khan and Zinta. For those interested in learning more about India-Pakistan relations and embedding themselves in a forbidden relationship between members of these two combative groups, Veer-Zaara is the perfect choice.
